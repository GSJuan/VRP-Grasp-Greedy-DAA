# Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) Solver

## Introduction
This project presents a coded solution in C# for the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) as part of Practice 7 for the Design and Analysis of Algorithms course at the University of La Laguna, 2021-2022. It explains the three implemented algorithms and the data structures used.

## Project Structure
- `Problem Class`: Represents the VRP, storing information like the number of available vehicles and clients, and a cost matrix for traveling from client i to client j.
- `Solution Class`: Represents a VRP solution, containing the total cost and a list of lists of integers for routes.
- `IAlgorithm`: Interface implemented by the three algorithms (GRASP, Greedy, and GVNS). Defines the `Solve` method which executes each algorithm and returns a solution.
- `EnvironmentStructure`: Interface defining the `LocalSearch` method implemented by all environment structures (2OPT, Reinsertion, and Exchange within and between routes).

## Algorithms
1. **Greedy**: Selects the best possible client at each step, constructing routes for each vehicle in parallel.
2. **GRASP**: 
   - *Initialization & Construction*: Generates an initial solution using `ConstructGreedyRandomizedSolution`.
   - *Improvement*: Applies improvements using the specified environment structure.
   - *Update*: Updates the global best solution if a better solution is found.
3. **GVNS**: 
   - *Initialization*: Uses GRASP for the initial solution and defines a list of environment structures.
   - *Shaking*: Applies diversification based on the initial solution.
   - *Intensification*: Uses VND (Variable Neighborhood Descent) for local search.
   - *Update*: Updates the global best solution if a better solution is found.
